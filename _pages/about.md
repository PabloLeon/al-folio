Research fellow â€¢ University of Warwick

My research is driven by how the mind learns to represent the world and how these representations allow inference. To analyze this, I contrast human performance in experiments with machine learning algorithms and computational models.

Currently, I am a research fellow at the University of Warwick trying to find the algorithm underlying human approximative inference with [Adam Sanborn](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/psych/people/asanborn/) and [Nick Chater](https://www.wbs.ac.uk/about/person/nick-chater/).

I did my Ph.D. with [Chris Lucas](http://www.christopherglucas.com/) at the University of Edinburgh. In my [thesis](./assets/pdf/thesis.pdf), I explored the representational principles that allow humans to generalize functions. My research showed that when faced with continuous-valued relationships, people learn abstract features of the data, such as the type or the variability of the function. These abstract features can then be transferred to inform their generalizations in subsequent tasks. Finally, my thesis showed that humans are perceptive to, and sometimes generalize according to compositional features inherent in the data.

Recently, I have worked with [Daphna Buchsbaum](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/daphna-buchsbaum) at the University of Toronto. In these projects, we explore how novel experimental methods can reveal the development of categorization in young children.
