Research fellow â€¢ University of Warwick

I am a research fellow at the University of Warwick trying to find the algorithm underlying human approximative inference with [Adam Sanborn](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/psych/people/asanborn/) & [Nick Chater](https://www.wbs.ac.uk/about/person/nick-chater/).

Before that, I was a Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Chris Lucas](http://www.christopherglucas.com/). In my [thesis](./assets/pdf/thesis.pdf), I explored representational principles underlying human function generalization. My research showed that when faced with continuous-valued relationships, people learn abstract features of the data, such as the type or the variability of the function. These abstract features can then be transferred to inform their generalizations in subsequent tasks. Finally, my thesis showed that humans are perceptive to, and sometimes generalize according to the data's compositional features.

I have recently also worked in developmental psychology, exploring novel experimental methods to reveal the development of categorizations under the supervision of [Daphna Buchsbaum](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/daphna-buchsbaum) at the University of Toronto.

In general, my research is driven by how the (human) mind learns to represent the world and how these representations allow generalization and transfer. To analyze this, I contrast human learning with machine learning algorithms and computational models.
